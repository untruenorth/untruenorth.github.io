A clickable collection of NC500 accomodation gathered from helpful CSC folks.

## Health warning
I'm abusing a few things to make this fly as I didn't start with the intent of putting this on the internet. 

Click the below 'image' to open the viewer. You can then scroll around, zoom in/out, and click the text boxes to link out to the Google location map for each hotel/B&B location. "X" on top right will exit the viewer and back to sanity.

Next step will be overlaying route segments, again linking out to Google maps. That might have to wait until I've actually been up to Scotland; I need to spend time planning my own trip before spending too much time on *this*.
